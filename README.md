# Cal AIAA URC 2017

This year we will be competing in the [University Rover Challenge](http://urc.marssociety.org/) hosted by the Mars Society. This competition takes place yearly at the Mars Societies Desert Research center in Utah. It represents a step up in competition difficulty and will be a welcome challenge to the expanding AIAA Rover Team @ Berkeley.

To accomplish the tasks presented in the [URC 2017 Guidelines](http://urc.marssociety.org/files/University%20Rover%20Challenge%20Rules%202017.pdf) we will be using a frontend control interface and GUI written in Python. We chose Python since it has great libraries to accomplish the needed tasks and offers a known platform to ramp up the newer members. For the rover computer, we will be running a low level C/C++ application since we need to control the various motors, encoders, and low level electronics on board. Additionally, we will be using OpenCV for roverside image analysis (primarily during the autonomous task) and plan to have simple pathing functionaility built into the Command GUI via TkInter (and some numpy).
